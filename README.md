# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## E-learning react app 
This e-learning platform is designed to offer users the ability to view their courses, take quizzes, and manage their learning experience. Built initially with standard front-end technologies, the platform is currently undergoing a transformation to integrate React for a more structured and formalized approach. The core features include course viewing, quiz participation, and user authentication (login, register, and logout).

Main Features:
Course Management: Students can access various courses, view materials, and track their progress.

User Authentication: A robust system for users to register, log in, and log out of their accounts.

React Integration: The project is being refactored to use React, enhancing the overall user interface, performance, and maintainability.
