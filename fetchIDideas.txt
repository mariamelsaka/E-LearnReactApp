once click on enroll , all data for that card saved in local storage , this will not make u fetch again
then in specific page call data from the local storage
but what if it's a lot of courses ? that u need to go and back> 
we can say when path name change then clear the local storage 



other solution but i think it's more complex is to fetch data twice 
once when fetch all data
then send id in the pathname 
and call that id by fetching it again ?


or i will see in the api if it's can handle call specfic id from the output
without fetch again , because each time it's fetch it's give u new data? 
is this mean i can't do the second solution?
